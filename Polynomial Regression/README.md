# Polynomial Regression – Salary Prediction

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Polynomial Regression can model non-linear relationships better than Linear Regression using a salary prediction example.

## Dataset
- Position (categorical – not used)
- Level (independent variable)
- Salary (target variable)

## Objective
To predict salary based on position level and compare Linear Regression with Polynomial Regression.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Polynomial Regression (degree = 4)

##  Key Observations
- Linear Regression underfits the data
- Polynomial Regression captures non-linear salary growth
- Polynomial model gives realistic predictions

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
Polynomial Regression is more suitable when the relationship between variables is non-linear.
